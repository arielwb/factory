Vision

Build a content factory that produces templated “snackable explanations” (memes, emojis, slang, acronyms, biology tidbits, etc.), publishes them on SEO-friendly microsites, and distributes them via automated social posts. Revenue comes from ads + affiliates.

The factory model allows us to cheaply spin up many niche experiments and let natural traffic growth reveal winners.

Niche Ideas Portfolio
Fun/Volatile Niches

Emoji meanings (huge traffic, high RPM)

Programming memes explained (high RPM, dev audience)

Portuguese memes/slang (easy to dominate, lower RPM)

Funny WiFi/usernames (evergreen listicles, low maintenance)

Safe/Stable Niches

Acronym/jargon meanings (evergreen, constant searches)

Troubleshooting/error code guides (steady demand, spikes during outages)

Holiday/event explanations (predictable seasonal traffic)

Everyday biology questions (evergreen, authority from biologist co-founder)

Growth Strategy

Launch 2–3 pilot niches (Emoji + Acronyms + Portuguese memes).

Use social to seed initial traffic + backlinks.

Kill or pivot niches not meeting KPIs in 2–3 months.

Scale successful niches with more posts + adjacent niches.

Long term: bundle sites into newsletters, communities, or sell access to aggregated data.
